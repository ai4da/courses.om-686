    "# Creating Your First Model Using Pyomo\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pyomo** is a powerful tool for modeling and solving optimization problems in Python. It allows us to create and manipulate optimization models using classes and objects, and communicate with various solvers to obtain optimal solutions. Pyomo supports a wide range of optimization problems, such as linear programming, mixed-integer programming, and nonlinear programming. Pyomo is widely used in different fields, such as energy, logistics, finance, and engineering, to address complex real-world challenges. You can find more information about Pyomo on their [website](https://www.pyomo.org/) or their [documentation](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of modeling components and processes\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Pyomo model is composed of various modeling components that represent different aspects of the problem we want to solve. These components are implemented as Python classes in Pyomo, which we briefly describe below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Set*: A collection of indices that can be used to define the scope or domain of other components. For example, we can use a set to represent the products, customers, or time periods in a model.\n",
    "    - *Param*: A numerical or symbolic value that can be used to specify data or coefficients in a model. For example, we can use a parameter to represent the demand, cost, or profit of a product in a model. A parameter can depend on sets or other parameters.\n",
    "    - *Var*: A symbolic placeholder for a decision that we want to make in a model. A decision variable has a domain, bounds, and potentially an initial value. For example, we can use a variable to represent the quantity, price, or allocation of a product in a model. Variables can be scalar or indexed by sets.\n",
    "    - *Objective*: An objective is a scalar expression that defines the goal or criterion that we want to optimize in a model. For example, we can use an objective to minimize the total cost or maximize the total profit of a model. The objective function of the model can be either minimization or maximization.\n",
    "    - *Constraint*: A logical or algebraic expression that defines a restriction or requirement that must be satisfied by the variables in a model. For example, we can use a constraint to ensure that the supply meets the demand, or that the budget is not exceeded in a model."
