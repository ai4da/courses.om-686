    "\n",
    "Markdown is a simple and lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using plain text syntax. You can use Markdown syntax to create tables in Jupyter notebooks by using pipes (`|`) and dashes (`-`) to separate the cells and rows. For example, you can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "| Jewel Type | Value (CAD) | Weight (g) |\n",
    "|------------|-------------|------------|\n",
    "| Opal       | 11          | 150        |\n",
    "| Turquoise  | 9           | 150        |\n",
    "| Garnet     | 13          | 60         |\n",
    "| Jade       | 10          | 100        |\n",
    "| Onyx       | 8           | 125        |\n",
    "| Coral      | 7           | 100        |\n",

    "| Agate      | 5           | 80         |\n",
    "``````\n",
    "This will produce the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Jewel Type | Value (CAD) | Weight (g) |\n",
    "|------------|-------------|------------|\n",
    "| Opal       | 11          | 150        |\n",
    "| Turquoise  | 9           | 150        |\n",
    "| Garnet     | 13          | 60         |\n",
    "| Jade       | 10          | 100        |\n",
