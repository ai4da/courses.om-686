    "This notebook focuses on solving a supply network design problem (SNDP) using mathematical optimization. The objective is to find the minimum cost flow through a network that satisfies customer demand while minimizing shipping costs. The problem involves factories, depots, and customers, each with their own capacities and demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to formulate the problem, define the parameters and decision variables, and set up the objective function and constraints. By following this document, you will learn how to apply mathematical optimization techniques to solve real-world supply network design problems.\n",

    "In this problem, we have an SNDP with six end customers, each with a known demand for a product. Customer demand can be satisfied from a set of four depots, or directly from a set of two factories. Each node has a maximum capacity: the factories can produce a maximum amount of product, and the depots can support a maximum volume of product moving through them. There are known costs associated with transporting the product along the arcs, from a factory to a depot, from a depot to a customer, or directly from a factory to a customer."
