    "# Newsvendor Problem with Demand Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "The newsvendor problem is a classical optimization problem in supply chain management and inventory control. It deals with the challenge of determining the optimal order quantity for a perishable product with uncertain demand. The problem is named after the scenario of a newsstand owner who needs to decide how many newspapers to order for the next day's business.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the newsvendor problem, the retailer faces two types of costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Holding cost: The cost incurred for storing unsold items at the end of the day.\n",
    "- Shortage cost: The cost associated with not having enough inventory to meet customer demand, leading to lost sales or backorder penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal order quantity needs to balance these two costs while considering the uncertainty in demand. With perfect information about demand (which is never the case), the retailer could order the exact amount needed and avoid both costs. However, due to demand uncertainty, making the optimal decision is challenging. The newsvendor problem has applications in various industries, including retail, fashion, and perishable goods, where accurate demand forecasting is crucial for efficient inventory management and profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to formulate the newsvendor problem with demand uncertainty as a mathematical optimization problem, implement the problem using Pyomo, and solve it to obtain the optimal order quantity that minimizes the expected cost."
